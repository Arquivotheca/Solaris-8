 *	vol_db_remove: remove a device entry from the volmgt Device
 *	Reservation Database.  The database file is scanned sequentially

 *	A match indicates that the device is currently reserved.  Note that the
 *	decision to allow a user to remove a database entry must be made by
 *	a higher level entity.  This function will blindly remove an entry
 *	if it exists and silently ignore the non-existence of a requested
 *	record.
 *
 *	This function is a little kludgier than the rest in this module.  To
 *	avoid having to deal with issues related to creation of a new file
 *	each time an entry is removed, the entire file contents are buffered
 *	into a malloc'ed memory block and then scanned from there.  Each non-
 *	matching entry scanned from the buffer is written back to the database
 *	file (which gets rewound following the file read).  If a matching
 *	entry(s) is found it is simply skipped over.  Once the file has been
 *	rewritten it is truncated by the length of the removed entry(s).  In
 *	other words, if multiple entries for the same record exist, they will
 *	all be removed.
 *
 * arguments:
 *	dbid - an identifier for the database to be accessed
 *	dev - the major/minor device pair uniquely identifying the record to
 *		be removed from the database.
