This directory contains sources to build libldap.so.4.  Please note that
libldap.so.3 (older version of libldap) relies on sources stored in this
directory to build the old version (.3).

If you are modifying libldap, you ***MUST*** ensure your modifications do
not cause any compatibility issues with libldap.so.3 version.  If that is
the case, you MUST copy unmodified files into usr/src/lib/libldap3 area
before modifying them in this directory.

For example if you are modifying common/bind.c in an incompatible way (I
have no idea why one would do this), you need to make a local copy of bind.c
in usr/src/lib/libldap3/common first.  This would ensure libldap.so.3
remains compatible.
