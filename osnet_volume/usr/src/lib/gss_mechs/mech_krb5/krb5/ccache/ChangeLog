Fri Mar 17 19:19:07 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (LDFLAGS):  Remove, duplicates config/pre.in.
	(CFLAGS):  Add -I options for file and stdio, to avoid paths in
	#include statements.
	(all-mac, clean-mac):  Add.
	* ccdefops.c:  Avoid includes with pathnames, since they don't work
	on the Mac.  Configure the default cache based on whether the
	system has <sys/types.h> (which defines types for low-level file
	operations, among other things).
	* configure.in (CONFIG_DIRS):  Build stdio before file, for Mac
	convenience (where file doesn't build).
