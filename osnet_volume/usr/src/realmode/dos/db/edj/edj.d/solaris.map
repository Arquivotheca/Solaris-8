#   Composite filesystem mapping file
#   Each line (other than comments) in this mapping file must be of the form:
#	ufs pathname	DOS pathname	flags
#   where
#	ufs pathname specifies the file on the Solaris boot device that is
#	    to be replaced or augmented;
#	DOS pathname specifies the file on the MDB diskette that replaces
#	    or is concatenated with the file on the boot device;
#	optional flags are the letter "c" for file concatenation (rather than
#	    file replacement), and/or the letter "t" for text files to ensure
#	    that the unix end-of-line convention is enforced.
#   There is no maximum line length.
#
#   New device drivers can be loaded during the MDB / Solaris sequence
#   by specifying the DOS pathnames for the equivalent ufs pathnames
#   (where "device" and "vendor" are replaced with the appropriate
#   strings):
#
#	/kernel/drv/device	\vendor\device
#	/kernel/drv/device.conf	\vendor\device.cnf	t
