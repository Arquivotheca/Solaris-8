"Help: Select Solaris System Version

A supplemental driver diskette contains drivers and patches for several
Solaris system versions. Be sure to match the supplemental driver version
with the version of the Solaris system being used.

Once the Solaris system version is chosen, the drivers and patches 
will be loaded from each supplemental driver diskette based on the chosen
version.

If a supplemental driver diskette does not contain drivers and patches for
the chosen version, the program will issue a warning and prompt for
another diskette to load.

If you accidentally inserted the wrong diskette, insert the correct
one and choose Continue.

If the system version to be installed is different from the one chosen,
choose Cancel. (Note that, when Cancel is chosen, all previously read
updates will be discarded and all supplemental driver diskettes must be
read again.)"
