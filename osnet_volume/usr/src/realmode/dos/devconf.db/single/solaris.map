#
#   Composite filesystem mapping file
#
#   Each line (other than comments) in this mapping file must be of the form:
#	ufs pathname	DOS pathname	flags
#   where
#	ufs pathname specifies the file on the Solaris boot device that is
#	    to be replaced or augmented;
#	DOS pathname specifies a path substitution or the file on the
#	    diskette that replaces or is concatenated with the file on the
#	    boot device.  The pathname may optionally begin with a volume
#	    specifier delineated by :'s or []'s;
#	optional flags are the letter "p" to indicate a path mapping,
#	    the letter "c" for file concatenation (rather than
#	    file replacement), and/or the letter "t" for text files to ensure
#	    that the unix end-of-line convention is enforced.
#
#	Note that the effect of path mappings is cumulative.  I.E., each
#	path mapping in the file is applied to the "current" path.  For
#	example, assume the following mappings:
#
#		/boot/solaris	/solaris p
#		/solaris/befs	:befsdisk:/befs
#
#	An attempt to open /boot/solaris/fish.bef would actually result in
#	an attempt to open /befs/fish.bef on the volume 'befsdisk'.
#
#   There is no maximum line length.
