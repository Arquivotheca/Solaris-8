#
#  NOTE:  When a change is made to the source file for
#  /etc/minor_perm, a corresponding change must be made to
#  this class-action script.
#
#  -	If an existing entry in minor_perm is having its
#	attributes e.g. permissions, ownership changed,
#	add it to the list produced by make_chattr_list below.
#
#  -	If an existing entry must be deleted, add it to
#	the list produced by make_delete_list below.
#
#  -	If a new entry must be added to the file, add it to the
#	list produced by make_add_list.
#
#  -	If a new entry is being added to minor_perm, but there
#	may already be devices of that name on the system (e.g.
#	we used the system default permissions in a previous release),
#	and those old devices now need to have their attributes changed,
#	add it to the make_chattr_list AND the make_add_list lists
#

#
#  If an entry in /etc/minor_perm needs to have its attributes
#  changed, identify the entry in the list copied to /etc/chattr.$$
#  by this function.   The fields are:
#
#  <device>:<minor> <old_attrs> <new_attrs> <optional list of logical
#					      devices whose attributes
#					      will need to be changed>
#
#  where an <attribute list> := <perm> <user> <group>
