Completion has a habit of doing the wrong thing after a
backslash/newline.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you suspend "man", zle seems to get into cooked mode.  It works ok
for plain "less".
It is not specific neither to man nor to zsh.
E.g. call the following program foo:
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int status;

    if (!fork())	/* child */
	execvp(argv[1], argv + 1);
    else		/* parent */
	wait(&status);
}
Then if you suspend
% foo less something
from zsh/bash, zle/readline gets into cooked mode.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
% zsh -c 'cat a_long_file | less ; :'
can be interrupted with ^C. The prompt comes back and less is orphaned.
If you go to the end of the file with less and cat terminates, ^C
will not terminate less. The `; :' after less forces zsh to fork before
executing less.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pattern %?* matches names beginning with %? instead of names with at
least two characters beginning with %. This is a hack to allow %?foo job
substitution without quoting. This behaviour is incompatible with sh
and ksh and may be removed in the future. A good fix would be to keep
such patterns unchanged if they do not match regardless of the state of
the nonomatch and nullglob options.

Username completion may cause SEGV on SunOS 4.1.3 and NIS.
This is not a zsh bug.  See Etc/MACHINES for details.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
sed seems to be broken on HP-UX 10.20 which prevents prototype
generation and the result is that zsh fails to compile.  sed in
HP-UX 9.x works.  Get an older working sed, get GNU sed or try to
get a fixed version from your OS vendor (or write a makepro.sed
which works on all platforms where the current version works).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numeric ranges are still too greedy with using characters; for example,
<1-1000>33 will not match 633 because the 633 matches the range.  Some
backtracking will be necessary.
