#
# Makes the local machine a firewall
#
# Assumption: this is run at the high level of security. Other
# ASET tasks are making sure that there is no + in /etc/hosts.equiv
# and no /.rhosts files.
# 
# This script does 2 things:
#
# 1) Turn the kernel variable 'ip_forwarding' off, thereby ensuring
#    that the firewall will not pass on IP packets.
#
# 2) Ensure in.routed is started with -q flag. This prevents routing info
#    from being visible.  This could be done by editing /etc/rc.local.
#    But it could be error-prone. What we will do is:
#
#    - Move /usr/etc/in.routed to /usr/etc/in.routed.asetoriginal
#    - Create a script in the name of /usr/etc/in.routed that turns around
#      and calls /usr/etc/in.routed.asetoriginal with -q flag.
