# The netmasks file associates Internet Protocol (IP) address
# masks with IP network numbers.

# 	network-number	netmask
#
# The term network-number refers to a number obtained from the Internet Network
# Information Center.  Currently this number is restricted to being a class
# A, B, or C network number.  In the future we should be able to support
# arbitrary network numbers per the Classless Internet Domain Routing
# guidelines.
#
# Both the network-number and the netmasks are specified in
# "decimal dot" notation, e.g:
#
# 		128.32.0.0 255.255.255.0
