/*
 * a word on memory management and ifslists:
 *
 * since ifslists are often passed as context to callback functions,
 * they cannot be freed when the interface they represent is dropped
 * or released (or when those callbacks finally go off, they will be
 * hosed).  to handle this situation, ifslists are reference counted.
 * here are the rules for managing ifslists:
 *
 * an ifslist is created through insert_ifs().  along with
 * initializing the ifslist, this puts a hold on the ifslist through
 * hold_ifs().
 *
 * whenever an ifslist is released or dropped (implicitly or
 * explicitly), remove_ifs() is called, which sets the DHCP_IF_REMOVED
 * flag and removes the interface from the internal list of managed
 * interfaces.  lastly, remove_ifs() calls release_ifs() to remove the
 * hold acquired in insert_ifs().  if this decrements the hold count
 * on the interface to zero, then free_ifs() is called.  if there are
 * holds other than the hold acquired in insert_ifs(), the hold count
 * will still be > 0, and the interface will remain allocated (though
 * dormant).
 *
 * whenever a callback is scheduled against an ifslist, another hold
 * must be put on the ifslist through hold_ifs().
 *
 * whenever a callback is called back against an ifslist,
 * release_ifs() must be called to decrement the hold count, which may
 * end up freeing the ifslist if the hold count becomes zero.
 *
 * if release_ifs() returns 0, then there are no remaining holds
 * against this ifslist, and the ifslist in fact no longer exists.
 *
 * since some callbacks may take a long time to get called back (such
 * as timeout callbacks for lease expiration, etc), it is sometimes
 * more appropriate to cancel the callbacks and call release_ifs() if
 * the cancellation succeeds.  this is done in remove_ifs() for the
 * lease, t1, and t2 callbacks.
 *
 * in general, a callback should also call verify_ifs() when it gets
 * called back in addition to release_ifs(), to make sure that the
 * interface is still in fact under the dhcpagent's control.  to make
 * coding simpler, there is a third function, check_ifs(), which
 * performs both the release_ifs() and the verify_ifs().  in addition,
 * if check_ifs() detects that the callback has the last hold against
 * a given interface, it informs it instead of performing the final
 * release, and thus allows it to clean up appropriately before
 * performing the final release.
