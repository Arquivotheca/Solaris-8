#
# This file contains tunable parameters for dhcpagent(1M).
#

# All parameters can be tuned for a specific interface by prepending
# the interface name to the parameter name.  For example, to make
# RELEASE_ON_SIGTERM happen on all interfaces except hme0, specify:
#
# hme0.RELEASE_ON_SIGTERM=no
# RELEASE_ON_SIGTERM=yes

# By default, when the DHCP agent is sent a SIGTERM, all managed
# interfaces are dropped.  By uncommenting the following
# parameter-value pair, all managed interfaces are released instead.
#
# RELEASE_ON_SIGTERM=yes

# When the DHCP agent gets an ACK from the server, it sends an ARP
# request to verify that a given IP address is not already in use.  If
# an ARP reply is received, the DHCP agent declines the server's
# offer.  However, if the DHCP agent is unable to send the ARP request
# packet for whatever reason, it assumes the address is available.  To
# be more cautious, uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
#
# IGNORE_FAILED_ARP=no

# By default, the DHCP agent waits 3 seconds to collect OFFER
# responses to a DISCOVER.  If it receives no OFFERs in this time, it
# then waits for another 3 seconds, and so forth.  To change this
# behavior, set and uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
# Note: this does not control the retransmission strategy for
# DISCOVERs, which is formally specified in RFC 2131.  This parameter
# is specified in seconds.
#
# OFFER_WAIT=

# By default, the DHCP agent waits 1000 milliseconds to collect ARP
# replies to an ARP request when verifying that an IP address is not
# in use.  To change this behavior, set and uncomment the following
# parameter-value pair.  This parameter is specified in milliseconds.
#
# ARP_WAIT=

# By default, the DHCP agent does not send out a client identifier
# (and hence, the chaddr field is used by the DHCP server as the
# client identifier.)  To make the DHCP agent send a client
# identifier, set and uncomment the following parameter-value pair.
# Note that by default this is treated as an NVT ASCII string.  To
# specify a binary value, prepend "0x" to a sequence of hexadecimal
# digits (for example, the value 0xAABBCC11 would set the client
# identifier to the 4-byte binary sequence 0xAA 0xBB 0xCC 0x11).
#
# CLIENT_ID=

# By default, a parameter request list requesting a subnet mask (1),
# router (3), hostname (12), and encapsulated vendor options (43), is
# sent to the DHCP server when the DHCP agent sends requests.
# However, if desired, this can be changed by altering the following
# parameter-value pair.  Note that each option should be separated by
# a comma.  For example, the value 20,30,40 requests that the DHCP
# server return the values for DHCP option codes 20, 30, and 40, as
# defined in RFC 2132.
