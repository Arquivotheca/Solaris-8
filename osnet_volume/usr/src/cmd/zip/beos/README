zip 2.2 for BeOS

KNOWN BUGS

- zip will archive attributes associated with symbolic links... this would 
  work if get_attr_dir() could return the _link's_ attributes instead of 
  the link's _target's_ attributes dir... this will be fixed in a future
  version of BeOS

FEATURES

- stores BeOS Preview Release's new file attributes, compressing them if 
  possible

- zip files are created with the correct file type (application/zip)

- supports both Metrowerks CodeWarrior and GNU C

Please report any bugs to the Zip-Bugs mailing list; our email address is
zip-bugs@lists.wku.edu.  If it's something BeOS-specific, you could email
me directly.
