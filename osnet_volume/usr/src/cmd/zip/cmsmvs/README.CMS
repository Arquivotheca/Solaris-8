Thank you for trying this first port of ZIP for VM/CMS and MVS!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional notes from Greg Hartwig (7/96):

The ZIP MODULE has been packed to preserve CMS line ends
and is shipped as ZIP.MOD.
To restore it to an executable module on CMS, do the following:
1. Upload it to CMS as a Fixed file with LRECL 1024.
   Example, from a DOS or OS/2 window, type this:
      SEND zip.mod A:zip module a (RECFM F LRECL 1024

2. Use COPYFILE to unpack the file.
   Example, in CMS type this:
      COPYFILE ZIP MODULE A (UNPACK REPLACE OLDDATE

'+' and '-' are valid characters in CMS file names, so the code
to remove them is no longer done for CMS (MVS only).

I don't have access to an MVS system, so my changes to the code
have only been tested on CMS.  AD/Cycle C/370 V1R2.0 was used
to compile the code.

                        Using under VM/CMS:
                    ---------------------------

1. To use the Info-ZIP's ZIP under VM/CMS you need:

   - C/370 ver 2.1 compiler or another compatible compiler supporting
     long names for function/variable names.

   - that the disk where the compiler is on is accessed

   - at least the following nucleus extensions (display of NUCXMAP):

     NAME      ENTRY    USERWORD ORIGIN   BYTES   AMODE (Attributes)
     EDCX24    0038B000 00000000 0038B000 00002FD8  ANY  SYSTEM
     EDCXV     001D1000 00000000 001D1000 000824C8   31  SYSTEM

2. To compile the program under VM/CMS do :

   - unzip all the files from zip22.zip file. They are stored as
     ASCII format so you have to unzip them first on PC or other
     system that already have UNZIP, and then upload them to the
     mainframe with ASCII to EBCDIC conversion.

   - execute ZIPVMC to compile and link all the sources.

   - if everything is ok you will get an ZIP MODULE

   - the warnings about the duplicated ASCII and EBCDIC symbols
     are OK :-)

3. Using ZIP

   - Just read MANUAL

   - A few exceptions concerning VM/CMS

     3.1. use always filename.filetype.mdisk format to specify
          vm/cms files

     3.2. if you want to make a portable zip file that is to be unzipped
          on ASCII based systems use the -a option

     3.3. If you want to zip the input files as binary ebcdic files
          use the -B (capital letter) option

     3.4. The date/end the time of the input files is set in the zip's
          dir to the current system date/time

     3.5. Without specifying the "-a" or "-B" option, the ZIP program
          defaults to "native" (EBCDIC) mode and tries to preserve the
          file information (LRECL,BLKSIZE..)
          So when you UNZIP a file zipped with ZIP under VM/MVS it
          restores the file info.

          There currently some problems with file with RECFM=V*
          I don't save the length of each record yet :-)

     3.6. No wildcards are supported as input file names:

          So you CAN'T use things like: zip myzip *.c

     3.7. If you have CMS PIPELINES installed you can use the MC EXEC
           as a MAKE utility to conditional compile all the sources
           using as input ZIP MAKEFILE.

     3.8. NO SFS is supported if you are using VM/ESA

     3.9. You can use DD names for zipfilename for example:
          'filedef input disk myzip zip'
          'zip dd:input file1.txt file2.txt ...'

Please report all bugs and problems to :
     zip-bugs@lists.wku.edu

That's all for now.

Have fun!
