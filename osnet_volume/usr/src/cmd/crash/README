The crash(1M) utility will not be present in versions of Solaris after
Solaris 8.  The crash command is a utility for examining system crash dump
files, whose functionality is superseded by the new mdb(1) utility.  Refer to
usr/src/cmd/mdb/README and mdb(1) for more information about MDB.  The crash
command's interface was structured around implementation details, such as the
notion of slots, that have no relation to the Solaris operating system
implementation.  This source code must be maintained until it is removed,
but no new features should be added and no existing documented behavior should
be changed from now on.
