If you got this far and the "cmp"s didn't find anything amiss, looks
like you're in business.  You should install bzip2, bunzip2 and bzcat:

   Copy bzip2 and bzip2recover to a public place, maybe /usr/bin.
   In that public place, make bunzip2 and bzcat be
      symbolic links to the bzip2 you just copied there.
   Put the manual page, bzip2.1, somewhere appropriate;
      perhaps in /usr/man/man1.

Instructions for use are in the preformatted manual page, in the file
bzip2.txt.  For more detailed documentation, read the full manual.  
It is available in Postscript form (manual.ps) and HTML form
(manual_toc.html).

You can also do "bzip2 --help" to see some helpful information. 
"bzip2 -L" displays the software license.

Happy compressing.  -- JRS, 30 August 1998.
