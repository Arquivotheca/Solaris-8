This document contains some information about the flash PROM update
required on certain platforms in order to run the 64-bit packages.

Certain UltraSPARC (tm) based SMCC computer systems shipped with firmware that
is not 64-bit ready.  If you install 64-bit packages on these systems, only
the 32-bit packages will run until you upgrade the firmware. It is NOT
necessary to update the system firmware to run the 32-bit packages.

The following table lists the hardware family platform name (/usr/bin/uname -i)
and the required minimum version of the firmware (/usr/sbin/prtconf -V).

Please check your platform family name using uname(1), since many platforms
are marketed and sold in different configurations using different names.

SMCC computer systems not in this list ship with firmware that is 64-bit ready.
If your firmware version is higher than what's shown in the following
table, your firmware is already 64-bit ready.

Note that the timestamp portion of the version string is not shown in the
following table, however it is included in the output of /usr/sbin/prtconf -V.

	# Platform Name			Min. firmware version for 64-bit
	# (/usr/bin/uname -i)		(/usr/sbin/prtconf -V)
	#
	# SUNW,Ultra-1			OBP 3.11.1
	# SUNW,Ultra-2			OBP 3.11.2
	# SUNW,Ultra-4			OBP 3.7.107
	# SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise		OBP 3.2.16

SUNW,Ultra-1 and SUNW,Ultra-2 platforms ship with a flash PROM write protect
jumper in the 'write-disabled' position.  In order to update the flash PROM
on these platforms, you must power off the machine, disconnect the power
source, make sure you take adequate static protection (ie: use a wrist strap),
open the cover and find and change the jumper in the jumper block shown in
the following table.

	# Platform Name			Jumper Block
	#
	# SUNW,Ultra-1 			J2003
	# SUNW,Ultra-2			J2003
	# SUNW,Ultra-4 (*)		J3103
	# SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise	(**)	P0601	(clock board)

	*  SUNW,Ultra-4 (Ultra 450) ships with jumper J3103 connecting
	   pins 2-3, which is the "write-enabled" position.
	   The key switch also protects the device and must not be
	   in the LOCKED position.

	** SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise ships with Jumper P0601 (located
	   on the "clock board") installed.  If the jumper is installed,
	   the device is "write-enabled". If the jumper is removed,
	   the device is "write-protected".
	   The key switch also protects the device and must not be
	   in the LOCKED position.

The jumper block number is etched into the motherboard next to the
jumper block.

The Ultra-1 and Ultra-2 systems ship with the flash PROM write-protected
with the jumper on pins 1-2, the 'write-protect' position.

The jumper must be moved to pins 2-3 on these systems, to write-enable
the device allowing it to be reprogrammed.

Pin 1 is usually marked with a dot.

On some systems, the jumper may be located under a plug-in card.

SUNW,Ultra-4 (Ultra 450) and SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise systems ship with the
write protect jumper in the 'write-enabled' position, however, on these
systems, the front panel keyswitch must NOT be in the SECURE or LOCKED
position while running the flash PROM update program.

If you've previously changed the jumpers to 'write-disabled', you must
change them to the 'write-enabled' position.  For information on the
jumper locations on these systems, refer to the hardware documentation
for your system.

If desired, once reprogramming is complete, you may restore the jumpers
to their original positions.

For more information, including diagrams of the jumper locations
and power fail scenarios please refer to the following documentation.
