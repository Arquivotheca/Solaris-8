This directory contains sample programs that demonstrate how to use the
libelf library.  Manual pages for libelf routines are located in
section 3e: Library Functions.

Each of these sample programs displays or manipulates the .comment
section of an ELF file in some way.  Each programs also uses libelf
differently.  To learn more about ELF files and their format you should
refer to the "Linker & Libraries section" of the Solaris
AnswerBook and to the "System V Application Binary Interface" printed
by Unix Press.

The following is an overview of the source files provided:

pcom.c		print comment: prints the .comment section of ELF
		files ELF members of archives. Demonstrates how to
		examine a file opened with elf_begin(ELF_C_READ)

acom.c		append comment: appends to or creates a .comment
		section for ELF files.  Demonstrates the updating
		of a file with elf_begin(ELF_C_RDWR)

dcom.c		delete comment: deletes a .comment section from an
		ELF file.  Demonstrates the creation of a ELF
		file with elf_begin(ELF_C_WRITE)

tpcom.c		threaded print comment:  a threaded version of pcom.c.
		Demonstrates that libelf is MT-Hot and can be used
		in a threaded program.

Makefile	make file to build the above programs.



Building the demos
------------------

Before attempting to build the demos be sure that you have installed a
Solaris Developer Cluster and a C compiler (purchased seperatly) onto
your system.

To build the programs, do the following:

	% make all

To test the programs, do the following:

	% make test
