# Note (re: SUNW_1.2 .. SUNW_1.3):
# 	Even though the SUNW_1.2 and SUNW_1.3 versions now contain no 
#	symbols these versions MUST be present.  This is because applications
#	built on 2.6 Beta (when they did contain symbols explicitly) may 
#	depend on them. 
#
#	All symbol content for Solaris2.6 is now contained in SUNW_1.1,
#	and (the now empty) versions SUNW_1.2 and SUNW_1.3 must be kept.
