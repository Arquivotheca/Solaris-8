This directory contains sample code on how to use the Link-Auditing
interface of the run-time linker (ld.so.1).  The Link-Auditing interface
permits a user supplied shared object auditi objects that are
loaded and symbols that are bound by the run-time linker.  A full
description of the Link-Auditing interface and its uses can be
found in the 'Linker & Libraries Manual' which is part of the
Solaris AnswerBook.

The following is an overview of the directory structure and highlight
of some of the important files contained within:

Makefile	- Makefile to build the Link-Auditing examples
src/*		- source code
man/*		- Man pages for the examples

To build this example copy this directory structure to a directory
where you have write permissions.  Then type 'make'.
