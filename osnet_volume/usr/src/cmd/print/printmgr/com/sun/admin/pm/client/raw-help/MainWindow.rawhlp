<p>
There are three columns in the list:
<p> 

<b> Printer Name:</b> The name of the printer as specified during printer
installation. 
<p>

<b> Printer Server:</b> The name of the printer server for the printer
specified in the Printer Name column.

<b> Description:</b> A description of the printer as specified during
printer installation (New Attached Printer or New Network

type.

<p> 

The footer panel at the bottom of the window has two or three entries:

<p> 

<b> Default Printer: </b> If no naming service is being used, the
default printer for the computer on which you are running Solaris
Print Manager. If a naming service is being used, the default printer
for the naming service.

<p>

<b> Naming Service: </b> The naming service -- NIS or NIS+(xfn) --
that is being used for printing. This is not displayed if no naming
service is being used.

<p>

<b> Domain or Host: </b> The network domain you are working in or the
current host (if no naming service is being used). If you are
using a naming service, the list of printers includes all printers in
this domain.
