The adb(1) utility will be implemented as a link to the mdb(1) utility in
versions of Solaris after Solaris 8.  The adb and mdb utilities are both low-
level debuggers that can be used to examine user processes as well and the
live operating system or operating system crash dumps.  The new mdb utility
provides complete backwards compatibility with the existing syntax and
features of adb, including support for processing adb macro files.  Refer
to usr/src/cmd/mdb/README and mdb(1) for more information.  This source
code must be maintained until it is removed, but no new features should
be added and no existing documented behavior should be changed from now on.
