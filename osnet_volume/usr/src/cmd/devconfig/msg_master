# This is the master message file for devconfig.  Any time you create a new
# message or edit the text for an existing message, you must do it here.
# see the file `mkmsgs.c' for details on the format for this file.
# Running the tool on this file will generate 3 files:
#	devcfg_msgs.h
#	devcfg_msgs.c
#	devcfg_message.po

# We don't export any of these codes to the world, so ordering is not important
# here, and we can let the tool automatically generate the msg codes simply by
# specifying msg codes of zero.

# Don't worry about format in this file.  All text retrieved from gettext() is
# automatically formatted for the specific terminal's column width, although
# you can insert \n & \t whereever you like to override the formatter.
