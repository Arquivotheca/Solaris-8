:HelpIntro
[ Introduction to suninstall ]

suninstall is an interactive, keyboard driven program that is used to
configure installation properties.  Although the user interface is
similar to an OpenWindows application, suninstall does not support
mouse input.

suninstall provides extensive online help.	To learn how to use the
[help system], press Return when the 'help system' link is highlighted.

# When you boot the Solaris 2.2 CD-ROM, suninstall runs in a window
# under the install OpenWindows environment or directly on a terminal.

:About Help
[ Using the suninstall help system ]

suninstall provides online help. At any time, you can press the Help
(or F1) key to pop-up this Window.

The suninstall help system allows you to view many help topics.  These
topics often contain links to other topics.  These links allow you to
move from one help topic to other related topics.  They are displayed
in the Help Window within square brackets. The current link is always
highlighted.

Pressing Return when the cursor is located within a highlighted link
follows the link to the related topic. Try this now, by pressing Return
to follow [this link].

If a help topic contains more information than will fit in the window,
you can use the PgUp and PgDn keys to page through the text (try this
now).

The normal cursor keys (up, down, left, and right arrow keys, along
with the Home and End keys) also allow you to move through the help
topic.  Whenever the cursor enters a link, it is highlighted.  You can
follow the link by pressing Return.  Pressing the Tab key highlights
the next link, or moves to the first button below the help window if
there is no visible link, and pressing Shift and Tab moves to the
previous link or button.

Pressing Return when the 'Index' button is highlighted (or pressing
Help or F1 at any time) displays the help index, which is a high-level
index of help topics.  Pressing Return when the 'Previous Topic' button
is highlighted, or pressing the BackSpace key at any time, returns you
to the previous topic.	Pressing Return when the 'Exit Help' button is
highlighted, or pressing Esc at any time, removes the Help Window, and
returns you to the point in the application at which you first requested
help.

Now press Help (or F1) to display the help index, or Esc to return
to suninstall. If you choose to return to the help index, you might
want to select the topic [About the User Interface] to learn more
about the suninstall user interface.

:test link
[ Links ]

By pressing Return when a link is highlighted, you follow that link
to the topic. The suninstall help system remembers all the topics
you visit, and you can always return to the previous topic by pressing
the BackSpace key or by pressing the Tab key until the Go Back button
is highlighted, and then pressing Return.

Now press Return or BackSpace to return to the previous topic.

:About the UI
[ Interacting with suninstall ]

suninstall is an interactive, keyboard-driven program that is used to
control the installation process

During installation you will interact with a number of suninstall 
screens.  The screens are built out of a number of user interface
components including buttons, lists, text fields, menus, and choice
items.  These components are explained below:

  * [Buttons] - There are three kinds of buttons, which are displayed
	like this: ( Button ).
	  1. Action buttons display a single choice; pressing Return when
		 the button is highlighted initiates the associated action.
	  2. Menu buttons are displayed with an arrow following the menu
		 title, like this: ( Do it => ). This indicates that a popup
		 menu is associated with the menu button; the popup menu is
		 displayed when a Return is entered.
	  3. Abbreviated menu buttons are similar to menu buttons, except
		 that the current choice is shown to the right of the button.

   * [Menus] - Menus are associated with menu buttons and with some
	 lists; they are displayed when you enter a Return. Use the up and
	 down arrow keys to traverse the menu choices.

   * [Lists] - Lists allow you to select one (or sometimes more than
	 one) item by using the up and down arrow keys to highlight the item
	 and then pressing Return. You can scroll to additional choices when
	 a highlighted scroll indicator is drawn on the right side of the
	 list.

   * [Data Entry Fields] - These fields allow you to enter textual
	 information such as the name of your host computer. By default,
	 characters you enter are inserted into the field; press the Insert
	 key to toggle between insert and overwrite mode.  The left and
	 right arrow keys, Home, and End move the cursor within the field,
	 while the Backspace and Delete keys delete the character to the
	 left of the cursor. Press Return or Tab to leave a data entry
	 field.

   * [Choice Items] - These are similar to lists.  Use the cursor-
	 control keys to navigate between items, and Return to select
	 an item.

For more information on the key assignments used by the suninstall
program, follow this link: [Key Assignments]

[Context-sensitive help] is always available, and most windows also
contain a [help button] that supplies more general information that
explains what you are being asked to do.  Most windows also contain a
status bar that provides a one-line context-sensitive help message.

:control areas
[ control areas ]

In some windows, controls are grouped into control areas that are
separated by horizontal lines across the window.  Control areas are
usually used to separate groups of menu and action buttons from the
other controls in the window, like this:

      +-----------------\[ window title \]-------------------+
      | (File *)  (Edit *)  (View *)            (Help)     |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      |                                                    |
      |   various controls...                              |
      |                                                    |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      |          (Apply)          (Dismiss)                |
      +----------------------------------------------------+
      | Help message                                       |
      +----------------------------------------------------+

exclusive [choice items]

    \[X\] Fast  \[ \] Slow

:Context-sensitive help
[ Context-sensitive help ]

Pressing the Help key always displays a help topic that explains the
purpose of the current control, and what you are expected to do.  For
more general help, press the [help button].

:Help Button
[ Help buttons ]

Most suninstall screens provide a 'Help' [action button] that displays
general suninstall [help text].

:Footer Status Line
[ Footer status line ]

suninstall reserves the bottom line of the main screen and significant
popups for spot-help and status information. This line contains basic
navigation and configuration hints.


:Buttons
[ suninstall buttons ]

Action Buttons look like this:

    ( Exit )

When a button is highlighted, pressing the Return key activates it and
initiates the indicated action.  If the action involves popping up
another window into which you must enter additional information, the
button looks like this:

    ( Alternate Languages ... ) 

Menu Buttons look like this:

    ( File => )
 
When activated, they display a [menu] from which you can make a
selection to initiate some kind of action:
 
    ( File => )
    +-------+
    | Open  |
    | New   |
    | Save  |
    | Exit  |
    +-------+

Abbreviated Menu Buttons are similar to regular menu buttons, but
allow you to select one item from many.  They usually show a label to
the left of the button (the button itself has no label) and the 
currently selected item appears to the right of the button:

	Speed: (=>) Fast
                +--------+
                | Fast   |
                | Medium |
                | Slow   |
                +--------+

:Menu Buttons
[ Menu Buttons ]

Menu Buttons are displayed like this:

	( File => )

When activated, they display a [menu] from which you can make a
selection to initiate some kind of action:

    ( File => )
    +-------+
    | Open  |
    | New   |
    | Save  |
    | Exit  |
    +-------+

:Menu Item
[ Menu Items ]

Menu items are displayed inside menus, and indicate the actions that
will be taken when the Return key is pressed.

:Abbrevmenu Buttons
[ Abbreviated Menu Buttons ]

Abbreviated Menu Buttons are similar to regular menu buttons, but
allow you to select one item from many.  They usually show a label to
the left of the button (the button itself has no label) and the
currently selected item appears to the right of the button:

	Speed: (=>) Fast
                +--------+
                | Fast   |
                | Medium |
                | Slow   |
                +--------+

:Menus
[ Menus ]

Menus may be displayed when you press Return on a [menu button] or an
[abbreviated menu button].  Sometimes a menu may also be associated
with a [scrolling list].

One menu item always has the focus and is highlighted.  The Up and
Down arrow keys scroll through the items; pressing Return initiates the
action associated with the current item.  When menus have more items
than can be displayed in the menu window, a [scroll bar] appears on the
right side of the menu.

Menus items may have the following actions:

  o Selecting a menu item that is followed by a right arrow causes
    another menu to be displayed. 
  o Selecting a menu item that has an ellipsis (three trailing dots)
    causes a popup menu to be displayed.
  o Selecting other menu items causes the displayed action.

    +---------+
    | Open... |  <== displays a popup window
    | New...  |  <== displays a popup window
    | Save    |  <== performs an action
    | More => |  <== leads to another menu
    | Exit    |  <== performs an action
    +---------+

:scrolling lists
[ Scrolling lists ]

Scrolling lists appear similar to [menus], but the items in the list do
not represent actions.	Scrolling lists can be exclusive or
nonexclusive. Items on the lists are selected by pressing Return when
the item is highlighted.  Selected items appear with an asterisk.  The
following is an example of a nonexclusive list.

    Files to save:
    +----------------+
    | * memo.txt     |  <== selected
    |   junk.doc     |
    | * budget.123   |  <== selected
    |   budget.bak   |
    +----------------+

Items are deselected by pressing Return when the item is highlighted.

Some scrolling lists have associated popup menus, which appear when the
item is highlighted and Return is pressed.  The menu offers actions that
can be performed on the item.  For example:

    Select a file:
    +--------------+
    | memo.txt     |
    | junk.do +---------+
    | budget. | delete  |
    | budget. | back-up |
    +-------- | copy    |
              +---------+

As with menus, the window appears with a [scroll bar] on the right side 
when additional items are available.

:scroll bar
[ Scroll Bars ]

When a control has more choices or information than can be displayed
in the space provided, a scroll bar appears on the right side of the
control area.  The following is an example of a scroll bar on a control.

    +-------+
    | White |
    | Blue  |
    | Red   #  <= scroll bar
    | Green |
    +-------+

The position of the scroll bar indicates where the current item is
located in the list.

:choice items
[ Choice Items ]

Choice items allow you to selected items from a set of options.

Exclusive choice items allow you to select only a single option.
Selecting a new option causes the previously selected item to be
deselected.  Exclusive choice items appear as follows:

    \[X\] Fast  \[ \] Slow

Nonexclusive choice items allow you to select more than one item.
For example:

    \[X Save \]  \[X Log changes \]  \[  Notify \]

:data entry fields
[ Data Entry Fields ]

Data entry fields allow you to supply information to suninstall.  Data
entry fields may scroll horizontally to allow you to enter more
characters than fit within the field. 

When you first enter a data entry field, the contents are highlighted,
which indicates that the text you enter will replace the contents of
the field.  (In this mode an initial Backspace or Delete will erase the
entire field.)	If you want to edit rather than replace the field
contents, use the left or right arrow key, or the Home or End key to
navigate within the field.  Once you have entered editing mode in this
way (or after your first character input), the characters you type are
inserted into the field; the Insert key toggles between insert and
overwrite mode.

When you leave an data entry field by pressing Return or Tab, the
application checks its contents. If an error is found, a message is
displayed, and you are returned to the field to correct the problem.

:navigation
[ The suninstall Keyboard Interface ]

The suninstall program uses the standard console navigation keys (Tab,
BackTab, the arrow keys, Home, End, PgUp and PgDn) to move between and
within items on the screen. Since not all of these keys are available on
some terminals, control-key alternatives are provided.

Although many navigation keys are recognized, the basic rules are
simple: the Tab and BackTab keys are used to move between controls in a
window, while the other navigation keys (the arrow keys, PgUp, PgDn,
Home, and End) are used to navigate within a control such as a menu,
a data-entry field, or a set of choice items.

The following table explains the suninstall keyboard interface; follow
the links to learn more about each key:

 Key			  Alternative	Function Performed

 [Help]           Control-W     Displays online help
 [F1]             Control-W     Display online help
 [Tab]            Control-I     Moves to next control
 [BackTab]        Control-R     Moves to previous control
 [Return]         Control-M     Selects the highlighted item
 [Left arrow]	  Control-B 	Moves left within a control
 [Right arrow]	  Control-F 	Moves right within a control
 [Down arrow]	  Control-N 	Moves down within a control
 [Up arrow] 	  Control-P 	Moves up within a control
 [Home]		  Control-A 	Moves to beginning of field or control
 [End]		  Control-E 	Moves to end of field or control
 [PgUp]           Control-U     Scrolls contents down
 [PgDn]           Control-D     Scrolls contents up 
 [Delete]	  Control-X 	Erases previous character
 [BackSpace]      Control-H     Erases previous character
 [Cancel] (Esc)   Control-C 	Exits menus (popup and pulldown)
 [Control-L]      Control-L     Refresh screen
 [Control-K]      Control-K     Erases to the beginning of line

Certain keys listed above provide a means to [accelerate] navigation
between different [control areas] within a window.

:Accelerators
[ Accelerator Keys ]

When the suninstall screen is divided into different [control areas],
the PgUp and PgDn keys can be used to move quickly between them.  Their
functions are:

  o PgUp - Moves focus to the first control in the next control area.
  o PgDn - Moves to the first control in the previous control area.

The most common example is the use the PgDn key to move the focus from
a group of controls to the first [action button] at the bottom of the
screen.

NOTE: These keys may not be used for acceleration if they are necessary
to move within the current control, for example within a scrolling list.

:Tab key
[ Tab key ]

The Tab key always moves the focus to the next control in a window.

:BackTab key
[ BackTab key ]

The BackTab key always moves the focus to the previous control in a
window. 

NOTE: on some keyboards, the Shift-Tab key generates the same value as
the Tab key, so the control-key alternative (Control-R) must be used to
activate this function.

:Left arrow key
[ Left arrow key ]

In [data entry fields], the Left arrow key moves the cursor within the
field.	Within a set of [choice items], it moves the focus to the item
to the left, wrapping around to the right as appropriate.

:Right arrow key
[ Right arrow key ]

In [data entry fields], the Right arrow key moves the cursor within the
field.	Within a set of [choice items], it moves the focus to the item
to the left, wrapping around to the right as appropriate.

:Up arrow key
[ Up arrow key ]

Within a [menu] or [scrolling list], the Up arrow key moves up one line
in the control. Within a set of [choice items], it moves the focus to
the item above, wrapping around to the bottom as appropriate.

:Down arrow key
[ Down arrow key ]

Within a [menu] or [scrolling list], the Down arrow key moves down one
line in the control. Within a set of [choice items], it moves the focus
to the item below, wrapping around to the top as appropriate.

:Home key
[ Home key ]

Within a [menu] or [scrolling list], the Home key moves to the first
line in the control. In [data entry fields], this key moves to the
start of the field.

:End key

:Devconfig Main help
[ Device Configuration Help ]

Due to limitations imposed by the design of some x86 systems, it is not
always possible for Solaris to [automatically detect] all of the
peripheral devices installed in your computer.	When Solaris cannot
automatically detect or configure a device, you must supply the
information necessary to allow Solaris to access the device.

The device configuration program 'devconfig' lists all of the devices
that are currently configured in your system, and allows you to [view]
or [modify] the configuration information for these devices.  You may
also [add] (configure) additional devices that have not been recognized
by the system.

The program's main screen lists all of the devices that Solaris has
detected. If your [SCSI controller] or [Ethernet card] is not listed,
this means that the device is incorrectly configured, since these
devices should be automatically detected.  Shut down your system and
reconfigure the device according to the instructions in the 'Solaris 
Release Notes for x86' before attempting to continue installing or
running Solaris.

If you have other devices that are not listed, for example a
SoundBlaster card, use the [Add] button to tell Solaris about them.

NOTE: you will not be able to run OpenWindows until you have specified
      the configuration of your [pointing device] and [display adaptor].
      Neither of these devices can be automatically detected, so you
      must add them to the system.

For more information about the different types of device, see:

:Devconfig Device Conflicts
[ Device Conflicts ]

With the exception of [IRQ]s, which can be shared between some devices,
each device's configuration parameters must be unique. If two devices
are configured to use the same [DMA] channel, for example, one or both
of them will fail to operate correctly.

The devconfig program cannot automatically detect or resolve device
conflicts for you, but it can help you to determine where such conflicts
exist.

# << not associated with any widget >>
:Devconfig add
[ Adding a device ]

If your system contains a device that is not [auto-configuring], you
will need to specify its configuration to Solaris before it can be used.

Select the 'Add' button from devconfig's main window, to add a device.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig view
[ Displaying Device Attributes ]

If a device is auto-configuring, devconfig will allow you to view its
configuration information, but will not allow you to change it.  The
configuration information you view may help you to identify or resolve
[device conflicts].

# << associate with the entire 'display-only' window >>
:Devconfig show
[ Device Attributes ]

Since this device is auto-configuring, you may view, but not modify,
its configuration information.	Select the 'Dismiss' button to return
to the previous screen.

# << not associated with any widget >>
:Devconfig modify
[ Modifying device attributes ]

The devconfig program allows you to modify the attributes of devices
that are not [auto-configuring].  Select the device from the list
displayed in the main window and press Return.	Then select 'Configure'
from the pop-up menu.

# << associate with the entire 'modify' window >>
:Devconfig modify window
[ Device Attributes ]

This window shows the configuration parameters for the device you
have selected.	Use the Tab key to move between fields, the arrow
keys to move within fields, and the Return key to select a particular
configuration parameter. Select 'Done' when you have finished specifying
the configuration information.

:Devconfig autoconfig
[ Autoconfiguration ]

Solaris is capable of automatically detecting and configuring the
following types of device, so long as they have been configured
according to the instructions given in the 'Solaris  Release Notes
for x86'.

	[SCSI controller]
	[Ethernet card]
	[Floppy disk controller]
	[IDE controller]

The program will allow you to view, but not to modify, configuration
information for these types of device.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig IRQ
[ IRQ ]

This configuration parameter specifies the interrupt number used by the
device.  Solaris can share IRQs between devices, but it is recommended
(for performance reasons) that a unique IRQ be assigned to each device.
Some hardware cards are not able to share IRQ with other cards. Before
attempting to use a single IRQ for two or more devices, check the
manufacturer's documentation for that device.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig I/O Address
[ I/O Address ]

This configuration parameter is sometimes referred to as the 'I/O port'
or 'port address'.  It specifies the memory address of the device's
control and/or status registers. Each I/O address must be unique within
the system.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig DMA
[ DMA Channel ]

This configuration parameter specifies the channel number that the
device uses to transfer data directly to the computer's memory without
accessing the computer's CPU.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Memory Address
[ Memory Address ]

Some cards have small memory buffers that are used as transfer areas for
data to and from the device. This configuration parameter specifies the
address of this memory on the card.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Display adaptor
[ Display Adaptor ]

In order to configure OpenWindows, you must provide the following
information about your video display adapter:

    o Resolution

	The resolution at which your display adaptor should be run.

    o Screen Size

	The approximate size of your display monitor. Use the following
	information as a guideline: if you have a laptop computer,select
	6x4" or 7.5x6"; if you have a 14" diagonal monitor, select 12x9.5";
	for 17" monitors select 13.5x11", and for 19" or larger monitors
	select 15x12".

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Pointing Device
[ Pointing Device ]

In order to configure OpenWindows, you must provide the following
information about your mouse:

    o Bus Mouse

      The [IRQ] used by your mouse, and the number of buttons it has.

    o Serial Mouse

      The serial port at which your mouse is attached (select /dev/tty00
      for COM1, /dev/tty01 for COM2, /dev/tty02 for COM3, or /dev/tty03
      for COM4), and the number of buttons your mouse has.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Keyboard
[ Keyboard ]

Devconfig automatically displays the type of keyboard attached to your
system by examining the contents of the file /etc/defaultkb. See the
'Solaris  Release Notes for x86' and the pcmapkeys(1) manpage for
more information.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig IDE
[ IDE controller ]

Solaris automatically detects any IDE controller attached to your
system.

NOTE: devconfig does not display IDE controllers in the list of attached
devices.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Floppy
[ Floppy disk controller ]

Solaris automatically detects the floppy disk controller attached to
your system.

NOTE: devconfig does not display this controller in the list of attached
devices.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Sound
[ Audio Interface controller ]

Solaris cannot automatically detects the presence of a sound card in
your system. If you have a sound card, you must therefore [add] it.
You will typically be asked to provide the following information:

	[IRQ]
	[I/O Address]
	[DMA Channel]

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Serial
[ Serial Communications ports ]

You cannot add serial ports with Devconfig though you can view
currently configured ports.

See the 'Solaris  Release Notes for x86' for information on
configuring serial ports.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Parallel
[ Parallel Printer ports ]

You cannot add parallel ports with Devconfig though you can view
currently configured ports.

See the 'Solaris  Release Notes for x86' for information on
configuring parallel ports.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig SCSI
[ SCSI Controller ]

If you have configured your SCSI controller according to the
instructions provided in the 'Solaris  Release Notes for x86',
Solaris will automatically detect it.  If you have booted from the
network, and your SCSI controller does not appear in the list of
configured devices, you should immediately exit the installation
program and reconfigure the device.

# << not associated with a widget >>
:Devconfig Ethernet
[ Ethernet Card ]

If you have configured your Ethernet card according to the instructions
provided in the 'Solaris  Release Notes for x86', Solaris will
automatically detect it.  If your Ethernet card does not appear in the
list of configured devices, you should immediately exit the installation
program and reconfigure the device.

# << associate with entire 'select category' window >>
:Devconfig select category
[ Device Category ]

Choose the category that best describes the device you would like to
add.  For example: to add an SMC ethernet card choose "Network interface
cards" from this list.

# << associate with entire 'select device' window >>
:Devconfig select device
[ Device Selection ]

This screen shows a list of supported devices within the category you
have selected.	Choose a specific device from this list. You will then
be shown a property sheet so that you may specify the correct attributes
for the device.

Note that video display adapters are specified in terms of the type of 
the card (for example, ATI VGA Wonder XL) and the vertical refresh
rate at which it should be run (for example, 70 Hz).  For information
about refresh rates, consult the documentation for your monitor.
