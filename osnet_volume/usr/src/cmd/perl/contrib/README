This directory contains SMI-developed Perl modules.  Modules related to Solaris
should be placed under Sun::Solaris, which has been reserved for SMI development
by CPAN.  Modules involving Perl installations which do not run on Solaris,
or which refer to unbundled products, should seek ARC guidance for naming.
