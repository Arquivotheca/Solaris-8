# The rest of this script looks a mess.  But in fact underneath all the
# 'sed's and 'awk's it is quite simple.
#
# First it creates a list of all the device nodes in the /devices directory
# (by cd'ing to /dev, then doing a 'find' of all special files in ../devices
# doing an 'ls -l' of these files, and sedding the output to produce a list
# of the form 'major minor type name').
#
# As an added wrinkle it changes 'major' from a number to a driver-name using
# sed rules produced from the "/etc/name_to_major file.
#
# Then it runs the awk rules in the rule-base on this list to produce a list
# of compatability-links that must be created.  However, this does not produce
# the links themselves because of the next stage:
#
# Finally this list of compatability-links is inspected and where possible links
# to the SunOS5 names are created instead of links directly to the /devices
# directory
# (by 'find'ing all the symbolic links under /dev, ancomparing the
# subdirectory they occur in, and the file to which they point, to
# the comaptability-link information built above. If a match is found
# a command to make a link to the 5.0 link, rather than to the /devices
# entry, is created.  If not, a direct link is created)
# And then the list of link command is executed by a shell, or printed on stdout
# (in debugging mode)
#
# See -- not so complicated!  However the syntax of all these rules makes
# the code below nearly incomprehensible.  Fear not; the only part you need
# to change for extra devices is located in the 'RULEBASE' file.
