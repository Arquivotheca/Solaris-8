#
#	This Makefile defines all build rules for the directory uts/sfmmu and
# it's children. These are the source files which are common to all sfmmu
# implementations.
#

#
#	This was implemented by pattern matching rules of the form:
#
# $(OBJS_DIR)/%.o:	 $(UTSBASE)/common/os/%.c
#	$(COMPILE.c) -o $@ $<
#
# $(LINTS_DIR)/%.ln:	$(UTSBASE)/common/os/%.c
#	@($(LHEAD) $(LINT.c) $< $(LTAIL))
#
#	For each directory containing source. This proved to slow under
#	Nse because it caused a significant additional number of stats
#	and stats are real slow under TFS. If TFS performance should
#	improve, one might consider returning to the former implementation.
#	In the former implementation, this file (Makefile.rules) was not
#	needed and the pattern matching rules were in Makefile.files.
