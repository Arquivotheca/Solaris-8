usr/src/uts/i86/promif for x86			(please update as required)

Merge work (here and stand.i386/boot/promif) is done in July 1994.

1) The merge is mechanic and textual, no attempt in re-design this interface.
   There are other projects that will replace this piece of code.

2) Three kind of binaries are generated:
	#if defined(KADB)
		for kadb to use and linked together as libkadbprom.a
	#if defined(I386BOOT)
		for booters (inetboot and ufsboot) to use and linked
		together as libprom.a
	#if !defined(KADB) && !defined(I386BOOT)
		for kernel to use in *.o form

9 Jan, 1994:

    The new plan is to do away with most of the prom lib, keeping only those
routines that are truely common to the three prom clients (kernel, kadb, and
second level boot).  The modules that remain are:

	prom_printf.c
	prom_getchar.c
	prom_putchar.c
	prom_getverion.c
	prom_init.c

Everything else (which used the 3-way #ifdef's described above), has been
moved off into client-specific modules:

	.../psm/stand/boot/i386/prom.c
	.../psm/stand/kadb/i386/prom.c
