# This file is common to Solaris Intel Edition versions 2.5x and 2.6.
# It was created from both tested and contributed entries.
# The "st" tape driver is designed and intended to be user extensible
# and user configurable. You may change these entries to suit your needs.
# To support additional drives, or change existing entries, please
# refer to the st man page for details, or search for "st" on either
# the Solaris Documentation CD-ROM, or the Solaris 2.6 Documentation
# section of http://docs.sun.com.
# The st and mtio man pages also live in the Solaris 2.6 Reference Manual 
# AnswerBook.
#
# To contribute additional entries, or suggest enhancements to existing
# entries below, you may send e-mail to x86-certify@Sun.COM
# which is a submission mailbox (There is no reply mail, but submissions
# and corrections are collected).  Alternatively, you may use the
# driver request form at http://access1.sun.com/drivers/driverform.html
#
# For technical support, contact your usual support provider or visit
# http://access1.sun.com
# 
# If you wish to use EXB-8200C mode for Exabyte 8505's, you can use the
# entry below, which redefines the "high" density as 8200C mode.
# EXABYTE NOTE:  The st driver, on Solaris 2.5/2.51 only, is currently coded 
#                to overlook the last numeral of the device model number for 
#                Exabyte drives.
#		 This means that an EXB-8505 will be treated as an
#		 EXB-8500, and no entry here will override that.
#		 This problem was resolved in Solaris 2.6, and the
#                st driver will match all digits of the model number.
#
# When adding new entries into the "tape-config-list", or uncommenting
# existing entries, be careful. Lines in the middle of the list must
# end with comma, and the last line in the list MUST end with semicolon.
#
# Each record (line) in the tape-config-list below has the form;
#  SCSI-Inquiry-String,	 Text for /var/adm/messages,  Jump-Label,
#
#  "Jump-Label" points to an entry in the configuration strings section.
#
# For the following drives which are configured automatically,
# no entry is needed in st.conf:
# -
# StorageTek 9840
# -
