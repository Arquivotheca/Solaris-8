# xmod/README


	The contents of this xmod directory should only be of interest
to those who build releases and deliver source files for the source
product to release engineering.  Most developers will want to ignore
this directory unless they are responsible for internal source that
should be excluded from binary and source products.

    xmod_files - files deleted by 'make EXPORT_SRC' in usr/src
    cry_files - files saved after 'make CRYPT_SRC' in usr/src. They can
                then be added to the result of 'make EXPORT_SRC' and built
                to generate the domestic source product. Note that some of
		these files are not touched by 'make CRYPT_SRC', but are
		files that are renamed during the export build (see obj_files)
		and thus must be restored to the crypt build.
    obj_files - files to save from the normal build and restore into
		the export build, and to rename to <name>.export -
		we have to rename them so that 'make' doesn't helpfully
		rebuild them (which it will because of .make.state).
